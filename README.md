#### Overview - Great place to brush up on Redux concepts

###Solid foundation of what is going on with Redux:

- Redux contains our application state; generated by a series of reducers that we created.
- That state is then modified by calling action creators; action creators return actions, which flow through middleware, then into the reducers.
- Whenever a new state is produced it flows into our containers and those containers re-render themselves.
